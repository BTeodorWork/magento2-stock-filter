Easylife Stock Filter

Compatibility

Magento 2.0 dev-beta2


What it does
----------

The extension adds a new filter in the layered navigation with 2 options: In stock and out of stock. This way the user can filter only in stock products.
The extension can be used only if your store displays out of stock products. It makes no sense otherwise.
